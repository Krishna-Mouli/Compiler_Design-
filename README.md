Lab Programs 
the C program which is 3ADD_CODE.c is pretty straight forward 
to run it use "gcc 3ADD.CODE.c -o 3ADD.CODE
               "./3ADD_CODE"
               to run the ./out file
to run the lex programs make sure to have LEX and BISON installed 
the LALR parser must be run using 2 individual parser files "PARSER.l" and "PARSER.y"
